2. Activate the virtual environment:

3. Run the application:

## User Experience

The application provides an intuitive menu-driven interface. Users can easily navigate through options to perform various operations without needing to remember complex commands.

## Data Persistence

The application uses JSON files for data persistence, storing information in `anime_db.json`. This allows for easy data retrieval and manipulation across sessions.

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation to ensure proper data entry and prevent errors. It also handles cases where requested shows or episodes don't exist.

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement user authentication
2. Add search functionality for anime shows
3. Integrate with external APIs for additional anime information
4. Implement a graphical user interface for a more visual experience

This project demonstrates a practical application of object-oriented programming, database operations, and CLI design principles.
